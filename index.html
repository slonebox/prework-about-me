      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a nonprofit fundraising and marketing professional learning to code through Columbia University's full-stack development bootcamp</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Cincinnati, OH, but I have also lived in Boston, MA, Milwaukee, WI, and Newport, RI.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Running and cycling long distances, sampling and reviewing all craft beer, overly investing myself in athletic franchises that invariably disappoint, spending too much time on my Nintendo Switch, memorizing showtunes, and frequently trying to deposit as much information into my brain via Podcast as humanly possible.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>One that blends my studies in full-stack development with my current work of giving the public ways to connect with and support important social causes.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Upper East Side of Manhattan.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>As the digital fundraising officer at my workplace, I am often both awestruck and frustrated about how little I know about the Internet. I want to better understand the components of this digital ecosystem where we all spend so much time--and get better at my job in the process.</p>
